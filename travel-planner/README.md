## Components

### Layout System

Voyant uses a modular layout architecture with reusable components:

- **Header** ‚Äì Provides navigation and accessibility features using ARIA labels and keyboard focus states.
- **Footer** ‚Äì Includes semantic role definitions (`role="contentinfo"`) and high-contrast design for visibility.
- **Layout** ‚Äì Wraps the header, main content, and footer for consistent structure across pages.

### Accessibility

Voyant prioritizes accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`).
- ARIA labels for assistive technologies.
- Focus outlines and keyboard navigability.
- Color contrast verified for light and dark modes.

### Theming

The project includes **light and dark mode support** powered by CSS variables for a seamless color theme transition.

```css
/* Example color variables */
/* Dark theme */
--color-bg: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #0f172a, #1e293b, #020617);
--color-text-primary: #f1f5f9;
--color-text-secondary: #cbd5e1;

/* Light theme */
--color-bg: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #f8fafc, #ffffff, #f1f5f9);
--color-text-primary: #0f172a;
--color-text-secondary: #334155;
```

## Flights Page

The **Flights Landing Page** provides users with a visually engaging interface to start planning trips:

- **Search Form**  
  Includes inputs for:

  - Origin and destination
  - Departure and return dates
  - Passengers
  - Cabin class selection
  - Direct flight toggle  
    (All inputs are accessible with proper labels and focus states)

- **Tabs Navigation**  
  Switch between **Flights**, **Hotels**, and **Attractions** sections (UI only, functionality coming soon).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

Currently, the page is **not functional** ‚Äî form submissions and tab content switching will be implemented in future iterations.

## Routing & Project Structure

### Routing

Voyant now uses **React Router DOM** for client-side navigation.

Example route structure:

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<Flights />} />
<Route path="/flights/results" element={<FlightsResults />} />
<Route path="/flight/booking" element={<FlightBooking />} />
<Route path="/flight/itinerary" element={<FlightItinerary />} />
```

## Button Component

A reusable Button component was added to maintain consistent styling and behavior across the app.

## Flights Results Page

The **Flights Results Page** displays available flight options based on user input.  
Currently, it uses **mock data** to simulate results until the Amadeus API integration is complete.

### Features

- Responsive list/grid layout for flight results
- Displays mock flight details such as:
  - Airline name and logo
  - Departure and arrival times
  - Flight duration
  - Cabin class and price

### Data

For now, the data is static and located in a mock data file within the project.  
This setup allows for easy testing of the layout and styling before connecting to the live API.

## Utility Functions & Data Structures

Voyant now includes **helper functions** and **data interfaces** to streamline flight data handling:

### Helper Functions

- `formatDate(isoString: string): string`
- `formatStops(segments: Segment[]): string`
- `getCabinClassAndBaggage(flight: flightOffer):{cabin: string;bags: string;}: string`

### Flight Data Structures

- **FlightOffers interface**: Defines the structure of flight offer objects.

  Example usage:

  ```ts
  const flight: FlightOffer = mockData[0];

  console.log(formatDate(flight.itineraries[0].segments[
                      flight.itineraries[0].segments.length - 1
                    ].arrival.at
                  ).date));
  console.log(formatStops(flight.itineraries[0].segments));
  console.log(getCabinClassAndBaggage(flight.cabin, flight.bags));
  ```
